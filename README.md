## How the Strategy Works

### Core Concept
The strategy operates on a **grid-based hedging principle**:

1. **Risk Assessment**: Calculates position size based on account balance and risk level
2. **Initial Position**: Opens either a LONG or SHORT position with calculated size
3. **Hedging Trigger**: When price moves 0.4% against the current position, opens an opposite position
4. **Position Management**: Maintains both LONG and SHORT positions simultaneously
5. **Profit Taking**: Closes all positions when price reaches take-profit levels (0.8%)
6. **Cycle Restart**: Begins a new cycle after position closure

### Strategy Flow

```
Start ‚Üí Calculate Position Size ‚Üí Open Initial Position (LONG/SHORT)
  ‚Üì
Price moves 0.4% against position
  ‚Üì
Open opposite position (creates hedge)
  ‚Üì
Price continues moving
  ‚Üì
Take profit at 0.8% ‚Üí Close all positions
  ‚Üì
Restart cycle
```

### Key Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Entry Distance | 0.4% | Distance for triggering opposite position |
| Take Profit | 0.8% | Profit target for closing all positions |
| Stop Loss | 1.2% | Emergency stop loss (currently unused) |
| Leverage | 50x | Position leverage multiplier |

## Risk Management System

### Dynamic Position Sizing
The bot now implements a **risk-based position sizing system** that automatically calculates the optimal position size based on your account balance and selected risk level.

### Risk Levels

#### üü¢ Low Risk
- **Max Trades**: 10 levels
- **Account Usage**: ~90% of available balance
- **Safety Buffer**: 10% for fees
- **Recommended For**: Beginners, conservative traders

#### üü° Medium Risk  
- **Max Trades**: 8 levels
- **Account Usage**: ~90% of available balance
- **Safety Buffer**: 10% for fees
- **Recommended For**: Experienced traders

#### üî¥ High Risk
- **Max Trades**: 6 levels
- **Account Usage**: ~90% of available balance
- **Safety Buffer**: 10% for fees
- **Recommended For**: Advanced traders only

### Position Size Calculation Formula
```
Available Balance = USDT Balance √ó 0.9 (10% buffer for fees)
Initial Margin = Available Balance √∑ (2^max_trades - 1)
Position Size = Initial Margin √∑ Current Price
```

**Example (High Risk):**
- USDT Balance: $10,000
- Available Balance: $9,000 (after 10% buffer)
- Max Trades: 6 levels
- Initial Margin: $9,000 √∑ (2^6 - 1) = $9,000 √∑ 63 = $142.86
- Position Size: $142.86 √∑ $50,000 = 0.00286 BTC

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Environment Setup
1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp env_example.txt .env

   BINANCE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   BINANCE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
   ```

### 3. Binance Testnet Setup
1. Create account at [Binance Testnet](https://testnet.binance.vision/)
2. Generate API keys
3. Fund testnet account with test USDT

### 4. Configuration
```python
# Trading parameters (modify these)
symbol = "BTCUSDT"                    # Trading pair
leverage = 50                         # Leverage multiplier
side = "LONG"                         # Initial direction
risk = "High"                         # Risk level: "Low", "Medium", "High"

# Strategy parameters
long_entry_add = 0.4/100             # 0.4% entry distance
short_entry_deduct = 0.4/100         # 0.4% entry distance
long_tp_add = 0.8/100                # 0.8% take profit
short_tp_deduct = 0.8/100            # 0.8% take profit
```

### 5. Running the Bot

python main.py
```

**Note**: The bot will automatically close any existing positions before starting the strategy.

```python
risk = "Low"
# Recommended for: Beginners, small accounts
# Account Size: $1,000+
# Max Exposure: ~2% of account
```

#### Moderate Approach (Medium Risk)
```python
risk = "Medium"
# Recommended for: Experienced traders
# Account Size: $5,000+
# Max Exposure: ~4% of account
```

#### Aggressive Approach (High Risk)
```python
risk = "High"
# Recommended for: Advanced traders only
# Account Size: $10,000+
# Max Exposure: ~6% of account
```
